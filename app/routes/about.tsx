          <p>
            Hi there! I'm Yosuke Tommy Asai, a dedicated Site Reliability
            Engineer with rich experience in management and team building. ðŸ“ˆ
          </p>

          <p>
            Known for my excellent communication skills, I believe that clear
            dialogue is crucial for successful projects. One of my primary
            focuses is contributing to profits, ensuring that my technical
            solutions not only resolve issues but also add value. ðŸ’°
          </p>

          <p>
            My speciality lies in building robust CI/CD pipelines to automate
            release cycles and speed up deployment frequency. ðŸš€ I also relish
            the challenge of modernizing older tech stacks to stay ahead of the
            curve.
